Part I

1) What parsing method did you choose?
krl-compiler on the command line

2) What was the output of the test you ran in (4)? How many directives were returned? How many rules do you think ran?
{"directives":[{"options":{"something":"Bob"},"name":"say","meta":{"rid":"echo","rule_name":"message","txn_id":"TODO","eid":"1556"}}]}
It ran 1 rules for this query.

3) What was the output of the test you ran in (6)? How many directives were returned? How many rules do you think ran?


4) How do you account for the difference? Diagram the event flow within the pico (i.e. show the event flow from when the pico receives event to the directives being created).
